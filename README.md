## Problem Title
SIH 1653: Web based Selector-Applicant Simulation Software
## Problem Description
Background: Recruitment and Assessment Centre (RAC) under DRDO, Ministry of Defence carries out interviews for applications received against advertised vacancies and for promotion to next higher grade for scientific manpower inducted within DRDO. Description: The process of interviewing is a challenging task. An unbiased objective interviewing process helps identify the right talent. The basic process of an interview involves posing a set of questions by an interviewer and thereafter evaluating responses from candidates. Thus, the questions asked should be relevant and match the area/ expertise of the applicant and the responses should also be of relevance w.r.t. the question asked. Expected Solution: The proposed solution should provide experts as well as candidates a real life Board Room experience, starting with initial ice-breaking questions leading to in-depth techno-managerial (depending on the level of candidate) questions. It shall also be able to provide a quantifiable score for experts as well as the candidate for the relevancy of questions w.r.t. the area/ expertise of the applicant. Similarly, candidate responses should also be graded for relevancy w.r.t. the question asked, finally assisting in arriving at an overall score for the subject knowledge of the candidate and thus his/ her suitability against the advertised post.

## Idea:
1.Realistic Interview Experience:A virtual boardroom interface mimicking an actual interview setting.Ice-breaking introductory questions followed by in-depth technical and managerial questions (based on the candidate’s level).A mix of automated AI-driven and expert-curated questions.
2.Dynamic Question Selection:AI-driven question bank tailored to the candidate’s expertise area and job role.Adaptive questioning based on previous responses to ensure depth and coverage.Weightage-based scoring mechanism for question relevance.
3.Expert Assessment & Scoring:AI assists experts in evaluating responses with reference answers.Expert panel can override AI scores with justification.Final score computed using AI + expert evaluation.
4.Quantifiable Performance Metrics:Individual scores for question relevancy, answer correctness, and overall subject expertise.Comparative candidate analysis for objective selection.Customizable scoring models based on post requirements.
5.Report Generation & Insights:Comprehensive candidate performance report.Strength-weakness analysis for each candidate.Data-driven recommendations for selection or further training needs.
